  content: It so happens that I've already held my fair share of technical interviews (and I'm sure more will come) but I've yet to see such a unique combination of raw talent, pure passion and strong determination as the case with Stefan. He perfectly embodies the technical professional, ever-smiling and always optimistic colleague that we all want in our team. He has a keen eye for details and he's ready to go to great lengths to achieve perfection. It was a pleasure to work with him and I definitely see him as one of the best developers I've met.

  content: Stefan is not just a programmer – he's more than that, with a cherry on top. He has the necessary skills to handle projects from start to finish, while his knowledge perfectly complements the critical thinking required to solve tough problems, implement algorithms, adapt, and invent. He doesn't get stuck easily, and when he fails he knows the "why" and the "how to be better next time". To balance it out, Stefan's soft skills are just as trained because he knows how to communicate. He can make any presentation interesting and beautiful – be it about code, the JavaScript framework he had just invented, or his latest project. I experienced Stefan's proficiency while working with him on a few projects and at several contests and hackathons (yes, we won most of them because we were the killer duo there).
