  content: It so happens that I've already held my fair share of technical interviews (and I'm sure more will come) but I've yet to see such a unique combination of raw talent, pure passion and strong determination as the case with Stefan. He perfectly embodies the technical professional, ever-smiling and always optimistic colleague that we all want in our team. He has a keen eye for details and he's ready to go to great lengths to achieve perfection. It was a pleasure to work with him and I definitely see him as one of the best developers I've met.

  content: Stefan was a risky bet at the time - a recent school grad with very little work experience, already planning to go study. The task on his hands wasn't easy either - a new, growing team, complex product codebase and loads of business innovation happening around him and involving him. Through his perseverance and hard work Stefan quickly proved that it was a risk worth taking! One thing that impressed me most about Stefan is his ability to spot internal frustrations within the business and try and come up with answers to those. A lot of us complain and avoid the discomforts in our life - Stefan challenged the status quo and offered solutions, often not for his own benefit, that are still helping our teams today! Innovative. Patient. Bright. Open minded. Great breakdancer (ask him about that). Highly recommend!

  content: Stefan is one of the most passionate people that I've worked with. He is always ready to go the extra mile to improve and become one of the best front end developers in the world. Even if we've been colleagues for less than 1 year, we've been together to one hackathon, we gave a speech at CodeCamp together and in our free time we started to implement our ideas together. He is really one of the best persons that I have met.

  position: Technical Consultant at Appsbroker Consulting Ltd
  content: It's a unique and warming experience to spend time working, however remotely, with an individual who takes so much pride and puts so much passion into the work he delivers. All the work I've been involved in with Stefan has been delivered far beyond expectation, with many new features designed and implemented purely to make the rest of our lives easier, often totally selflessly in his own time. It's been a pleasure to work alongside you, Stefan, and thanks again for making our day to day life more efficient. Your efforts and contributions will remain long after you. A genuine asset to any development team.

  position: Full-Stack Developer at StarterSquad
  content: Stefan is not just a programmer – he's more than that, with a cherry on top. He has the necessary skills to handle projects from start to finish, while his knowledge perfectly complements the critical thinking required to solve tough problems, implement algorithms, adapt, and invent. He doesn't get stuck easily, and when he fails he knows the "why" and the "how to be better next time". To balance it out, Stefan's soft skills are just as trained because he knows how to communicate. He can make any presentation interesting and beautiful – be it about code, the JavaScript framework he had just invented, or his latest project. I experienced Stefan's proficiency while working with him on a few projects and at several contests and hackathons (yes, we won most of them because we were the killer duo there).
